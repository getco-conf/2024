SCOPE

The Geometric and Topological Methods in Computer Science (GETCO)
conference series focuses on applications of algebraic topology in
computer science with special emphasis on concurrency, distributed
computing, networking and other situations related to systems of
sequential computers that communicate with each other. It is aimed at
mathematicians and computer scientists working in or interested in
these subjects, including researchers and graduate students. The aim
of the conference is to exchange ideas and to initiate or expand
research collaborations.

This is the 13th incarnation of GETCO which has existed since
1999. The last two GETCOs were held in 2022 in Paris and in 2023 in
Aalborg associated with the Nordic Congress of Mathematicians.

We are calling for submission of original, unfinished, already
published, or otherwise interesting work within the topics of the
GETCO conference. The submission can be in the form of a poster, an
abstract, a paper submitted to or published at another conference, or
in any other format. GETCO has no formal proceedings, but as for
earlier conferences, we intend to publish a journal special issue with
revised and extended versions of a selection of the contributions.

Submission is via EasyChair at
