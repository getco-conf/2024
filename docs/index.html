            <p>GETCO 2024 will take place in Tallinn on Saturday, July 6th, and Sunday, July 7th.</p>
            <p>The Geometric and Topological Methods in Computer Science (GETCO) conference series focuses on applications of algebraic topology in computer science with special emphasis 
                on concurrency, distributed computing, networking and other situations related to systems of sequential computers that communicate with each other. It is aimed at mathematicians 
                and computer scientists working in or interested in these subjects, including researchers and graduate students. The aim of the conference is to exchange ideas and to initiate or
                 expand research collaborations.</p>
            <p>Special emphasis will be on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Directed topology, concurrency, and distributed computing</li>
                <li>Geometric aspects of logics, higher categories, and rewriting</li>
                <li>Dynamical/hybrid/control systems and robotics</li>
                <li>Topological persistence theory</li>

                The first GETCO conference was held in Aalborg in 1999. Applications of algebraic topology in concurrency was a new subject, fostered by seminal papers such as those by Vaughn Pratt in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99625">ACM POPL 1991</a> and Eric Goubault at <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2FBFb0084796">CONCUR 1992</a> and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=703498">CONCUR 1993</a>, on the formal methods side, and the ACM STOC 1993 papers by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=167125">Herlihy-Shavit</a> and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=167088.167122">Saks-Zaharoglou</a>, on the distributed computing side; brought to attention in the <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/98f1/52cef40066916dc541a4910c8eceae43c583.pdf">Workshop on New Connections between Mathematics and Computer Science</a>, organized by Jeremy Gunawardena in Cambridge Nov.&nbsp;1995.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The following seven GETCO workshops were held as satellites to CONCUR or DISC, the main conferences on concurrency and distributed computing. The 2nd was held at Penn State University, in 2000, then in Aalborg in 2001, Toulouse 2002, Marseille 2003, Amsterdam 2004, San Francisco 2005, and Bonn 2006.

                The <a href="http://people.math.aau.dk/~raussen/GETCO/GETCO10/">2010 workshop</a> had a broader scope and included further applications of algebraic topology including robotics and shape analysis. GETCO was back in Aalborg for its <a href="http://people.math.aau.dk/~fajstrup/KONFERENCER/GETCO2015/">9th edition</a> in 2015, expanding to topics such as data analysis. By then, an ESF network ACAT, Applied and Computational Algebraic Topology, had been established, and two books had been published, <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/distributed-computing-through-combinatorial-topology/herlihy/978-0-12-404578-1">Distributed Computing Through Combinatorial Topology</a> and <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319153971">Directed Algebraic Topology and Concurrency</a>; some of many indications that applications of algebraic topology to concurrent systems is now a mature subject, widespread and with impact in many fields. The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/geometricandtopologicalmethods/home">10th edition</a>, which took place in Oaxaca, Mexico in 2018, expanded further to neuroscience and learning applications. The 11th edition was originally planned in 2020 in Palaiseau and was held <a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~smimram/getco22/">in 2022 in Paris</a>.
